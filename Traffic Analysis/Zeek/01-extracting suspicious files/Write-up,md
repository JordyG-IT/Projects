# Lab 1: Extracting Suspicious Files with Zeek

**Note:** PCAPs and lab environment are from the TryHackMe *Zeek* room.  
Analysis, screenshots, and commentary are my own.

## Objective
Demonstrate how Zeekâ€™s File Framework can extract files from a packet capture (PCAP), 
identify file types, and correlate them across multiple Zeek logs to detect potentially malicious files.

---

## Tools Used
- Zeek
- Linux command-line utilities (`file`, `grep`, `zeek-cut`, `less`)

---

## Steps

### 1. Run Zeek on the PCAP with the File Extraction Policy

zeek -C -r case1.pcap /opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy/frameworks/files/extract-all-files.zeek
