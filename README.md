# Projects

This repository contains my collection of projects across different areas of IT, automation, and security.  
Each folder represents a separate topic or skill area, with its own scripts, labs, and notes.  

## Structure
- `Powershell/` → PowerShell automation scripts and experiments  
- `Traffic Analsysis/` → Labs and notes on network monitoring and analysis tools (including file extraction and log analysis)  

## Purpose
- Keep my learning projects organized and version-controlled  
- Track my progress across different domains  
- Build a portfolio of labs and scripts to share on GitHub

**Disclaimer:** Some labs are based on structured training environments (e.g., TryHackMe).  
All files and write-ups are for educational use only.
