# PowerShell Projects

This folder contains my PowerShell scripts and related experiments.  
Each script or mini-project is organized into its own subfolder for clarity.  

## Structure
- `script1/` → Individual PowerShell script + notes
- `script2/` → Another script or project
- (and so on...)

## Purpose
The goal of this folder is to:
- Store and version-control my PowerShell work
- Keep each script/project self-contained
- Provide a reference for future automation tasks and learning
